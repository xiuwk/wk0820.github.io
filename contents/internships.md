# Internships

- **Jul 2024 - Sep 2024**​​ Guangzhou Cloudwalk Technology Co., Ltd., Product Solutions Intern
    Responsible for the design and development of backend service architecture, implementing automatic scheduling and real-time response for user requests in high-concurrency scenarios. Independently completed the engineering reproduction, algorithm encapsulation, and RESTful API design for an AIGC project based on Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, providing stable and efficient artificial intelligence service interfaces for front-end productization. Thoroughly participated in the full system development lifecycle, encompassing requirements analysis, technical solution design, core code implementation, module testing, and cloud server deployment, significantly enhancing capabilities in distributed API design, microservices deployment, and the development and optimization of intelligent response systems.

- **Jul 2023 - Aug 2023**​​ GAC R&D Center, Mobile Terminal Intern
    Participated in the research and development of visual perception algorithms and system integration for an embodied intelligent robotics project. Main responsibilities included: assisting in the development of an open-vocabulary object detection model, combining vision-language models to achieve zero-shot recognition and segmentation based on natural language instructions; participated in the implementation of a 3D environment perception solution based on RGB-D cameras, involving depth completion, coordinate system transformation, and six-degree-of-freedom pose estimation; also supported algorithm deployment and optimization on embedded platforms, and participated in the development and debugging of a ROS-based inter-process communication system, contributing to the efficient integration of the vision module with the robot system.
